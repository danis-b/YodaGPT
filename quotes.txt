Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.
Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight, the Council does. But, agree with your taking this boy as your Padawan Learner... I do not
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that you do not. Agree with you, the Council does. Your apprentice young Skywalker will be.
Lost a planet, Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing... how embarrassing.
Go to the center of the gravity's pull, and find your planet you will.
Meditate on this, I will.
Clear, your mind must be if you are to discover the real villains behind the plot.
Pain. Suffering. Death, I feel. Something terrible has happened. Young Skywalker is in pain. Terrible pain.
Around the survivors, a perimeter create!
Powerful you have become, Dooku. The dark side I sense in you.
Master Obi-Wan, not victory. The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun, the Clone War has!
Much to learn, you still have.
Like fire across the galaxy, the Clone Wars spread. In league with the wicked Count Dooku more and more planets slip. Upon the Jedi Knights falls the duty to lead the newly formed Army of the Republic.
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
Careful you must be when sensing the future. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
Destroy the Sith, we must.
To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become.
The boy you trained, gone he is, consumed by Darth Vader.
I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor. Or should I call you Darth Sidious?
At an end your rule is... and not short enough it was.
Not if anything to say about it, I have!
Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
If so powerful you are, why leave?
Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be. As is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
Looking? Found someone you have I would say, mm?
Help you I can! Yes! Mm!
Awww, cannot get your ship out...eh-heheheh!
How you get so big, eating food of this kind?
Mine! Or I will help you not!
Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is!
I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
Hmm. Much anger in him, like his father.
You will be. You will be.
Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
You will know... when you are calm, at peace, passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
That is why you fail.
No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size do you?
And well you should not! For my ally is the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us... and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this... crude matter! You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you, me, the tree, the rock... everywhere! Even between the land and the ship.
Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past...old friends long gone.
Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.
Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
Mind what you have learned. Save you it can!
No. There is another.
When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good, you will not, hm?
Strong am I with the Force, but not that strong. Twilight is upon me, and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Your father he is.
Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will.
When gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be.
Pity your new disciple I do; so lately an apprentice, so soon without a Master.
War does not make one great.
Proud I am, to stand by Wookiees in their hour of need.
Yoda I am, fight I will.
Tired I am, rest I must.
When all choices seem wrong, choose restraint.
If no mistake have you made, yet losing you are ... a different game you should play.
A trial of being old is this: remembering which thing one has said into which young ears.
Think you I have never felt the touch of the dark? Know you what a soul so great as Yoda can make, in eight hundred years?
Think you the relationship between Master and Padawan is only to help them? Oh, this is what we let them believe, yes! But when the day comes that even old Yoda does not learn something from his students-then truly, he shall be a teacher no more.
On many long journeys have I gone. And waited, too, for others to return from journeys of their own. Some return; some are broken; some come back so different only their names remain.
Honor life by living, Padawan. Killing honors only death: only the dark side.
To be Jedi is to face the truth, and choose. Give off light, or darkness, Padawan. Be a candle, or the night, Padawan: but choose!
When you look at the dark side, careful you must be ... for the dark side looks back.
You think Yoda stops teaching, just because his student does not want to hear? Yoda a teacher is. Yoda teaches like drunkards drink. Like killers kill.
A labyrinth of evil, this war has become.
To the Force, look for guidance. Accept what fate has placed before us.
My ally is the Force.  
It is the spontaneity that you find so easily which others do not, that is what sets you apart.
A flaw more and more common among Jedi. Too sure of themselves they are. Even the older, more experienced ones.
Blind we are, of creation of this clone army we could not see.
Doubt in battle, there cannot be. Belief, there must be.
No greater gift there is, than a generous heart.
If in anger you answer, then in shame you dwell.
Arduous is discovering oneself, going on the greatest exploration it is.
Many of the truths that we cling to depend on our point of view.
Patience you must have my young Padawan.
You think Yoda stops teaching, just because his student does not want to hear? A teacher Yoda is. Yoda teaches like drunkards drink, like killers kill.
If no mistake you have made, losing you are. A different game you should play.
Your path you must decide.
Hard to see the dark side is.
Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an apprentice.
Clear, your mind must be, if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.
To answer power with power, the Jedi way this is not. In this war, a danger there is, of losing who we are.
In the end, cowards are those who follow the dark side.
On many long journeys have I gone. And waited, too, for others to return from journeys of their own. Some return; some are broken; some come back so different only their names remain.
To be Jedi is to face the truth and choose. Give off light, or darkness, Padawan. Be a candle, or the night.
The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see, the future is.
Feel the Force!
Powerful you have become. The dark side I sense in you.
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not.
In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.
Much to learn you still have.
Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
Named must your fear be before banish it you can.
Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is.
Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.
Fear is the path to the dark side.
Train yourself to let go of everything you are afraid to lose.
A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
So certain are you? Always with you what cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
A Jedi's strength flows from the Force.
I can’t teach him. The boy has no patience.
Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.
Smaller in number are we, but larger in mind.
Pass on what you have learned. Strength. Mastery. But weakness, folly, failure also. Yes, failure most of all.
You must unlearn what you have learned.
The greatest teacher, failure is.
When you look at the dark side, careful you must be. For the dark side looks back.
To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmm. Great care we must take.
A way, there always is.
You will find only what you bring in.
Always in motion, is the future.
We are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.
Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you, it will.
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you?
All his life has he looked away…to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things.
Soon will I rest, yes, forever sleep. Earned it I have. Twilight is upon me, soon night must fall.
For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the land and the ship.
Control, control, you must learn control!
Ah! A great warrior. Wars not make one great.
And of course: "Do. Or do not. There is no try.
Strong with the Force, you must become.
Patience, a Jedi’s greatest ally it is.
May the Force be with you, hmm, yes.
Dark the path of fear becomes.
To the light, cling you must.
Wisdom in silence, found it is.
Feel the Force, you will, if calm you remain.
Great power, the dark side promises, yet consumes it does.
With you, the Force may be, if choose it you do.
Difficult, the journey of a Jedi is.
Hate, to suffering it leads, mmm.
Trust in the Force, always you should.
Small my size, yet vast my strength is.
May the Force guide you, through trials it will.
Anger, a shadow on the heart it casts.
Lost, you are not, if the Force you seek.
Peace, a Jedi craves, not war.
Long the path to mastery, yet worthy it is.
In the Force, answers you will find.
Fear not the dark, but rise above it you must.
With you, may the Force be, hmm, strong it is.
Younglings, much to learn they have.
Through the Force, see you will, beyond the now.
Dangerous, the lure of power is.
Victory, not in battle it lies, but in balance.
May the Force be with you, forever it flows.
Greed, the Jedi shun, for peace they seek.
Hard to see, the future remains, always moving it is.
Hope, a light in the dark it shines.
Train hard, you must, to a Jedi become.
Knowledge, through the Force it comes.
Swift the dark side tempts, yet slow the light grows.
May the Force be with you, in darkness and light.
Courage, a Jedi must have, fear he must not.
To the stars, the Force reaches, boundless it is.
Anger clouds the mind, clear it you must.
Seek the truth, a Jedi does, not power.
With you, the Force is, if listen you will.
Long have I watched, patient I remain.
Stronger than fear, hope you must find.
Difficult to unlearn, old habits are.
May the Force be with you, guide you it shall.
Balance, the heart of the Jedi it is.
In motion, the galaxy stays, still you must be.
Pride, to ruin it leads, humble you must remain.
Feel you the Force, between all things it flows.
Great the burden of a Master, greater the reward.
Beware the shadows, for back they look.
With you, may the Force be, peace it brings.
Lost in thought, a Jedi is not.
To the end, endure you must, abandon hope you must not.
Darkness rises, yet stronger the light shines.
May the Force be with you, forever its strength endures.
Victory through force, a Jedi seeks not.
In the quiet, wisdom speaks, hear it you will.
Temptation, resist it you must, or fall you shall.
Faith in the Force, unwavering it must be.
Small steps, to greatness they lead.
Fearful, a Jedi is not, for the Force his shield is.
With you, the Force may be, if pure your heart remains.
Time, a teacher it is, patient you must be.
Through struggle, strength you will find.
May the Force be with you, in trials it stands.
Doubt, the enemy of action it is.
To the light, turn you must, or lost you will be.
Great the power of the Force, greater the duty it brings.
In chaos, calm a Jedi finds.
Steady your mind, for strong the dark side pulls.
With you, may the Force be, eternal its bond is.
Learn you must, from failure as from success.
Beyond the stars, the Force flows, sense it you can.
Peace over anger, choose it you should.
May the Force be with you, a beacon in the night it is.
Destiny, shaped by choice it is, not fate alone.
Strong I am, yet stronger the Force remains.
In the moment, live you must, not in the past.
Tangled the web of the dark side, untangle it you must.
With you, the Force is, if seek it you do.
Great the journey, greater the will it demands.
